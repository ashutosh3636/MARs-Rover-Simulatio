# MARs-Rover-Simulation
Simulation of Mars rover which has a four wheeled Bar differential double rocker suspension. I am using a Vehicle Box from simscape, configuring all the parameters required for the traversal such as wind speed, inclination of ground and initial velocity. The wheel is simulated by a MagicTire block from Simscape providing all the required data (mass and radius of the wheel). Finally the model was simulated and the result was recorded in Scope block, as the position, velocity and acceleration of the rover during the first 4 seconds of its traversal.
